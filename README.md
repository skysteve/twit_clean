# Introduction
Simple chrome extension to clean up titter in the following ways:

## 1. Hide menu options on the right hand side
A lot of the time I find I don't care about the menu options on the right of the page
and infact they are often distracting so there are options to turn off any combination of

1. who to follow
2. invite friends
3. copyright notice

## 2. Hide tweets with a specific hash tag
Sometimes you want to follow someone but they're running a campaign that you really don't care about.
So rather than be bombarded with tweets you have no interest in you can add the hashtag to a list that gets 
filtered out. For example at the moment [Barclays][2] is running a hashtag about some new cash machines they have
around London ([#FreedomToMakeaStatement][3]). I found I didn't care but at the same time I still want to follow my
bank incase there's anything important.

This will literally remove the tweet from your timeline.

## 3. Hide any tweets from specific users 
Similar to hiding hashtags, you can also choose to remove specific users from your feed without explicitly blocking them.
I felt that blocking users to remove them from your timeline was a bit over the top but at the same time didn't want to
see their tweets if they were re-tweeted by friends. 

For example I have a friend who retweets some interesting content and also the same couple of users regularly. The regular
users are of little interest to me so I wanted to filter them out.
